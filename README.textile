h1. ShareThis Fu

This plugin should help you easily and unobtrusively integrate ShareThis in your rails app.

h2. Installation

  script/plugin install git://github.com/uhlenbrock/sharethis_fu.git

This should create sharethis.yml in your config directory. Add your publisher key as well as any widget customizations.

*1. A javascript include tag in the head of your html layout*

    <%= include_sharethis_if_needed %>

*2. Declaration in controller of your choice*

    uses_sharethis

*3. Within the view where the button should appear*

  <%= sharethis :entry => { :title => "Title to be shared.", :url => "http://www.sharethis.com/" } %>

h2. TODO

* Write more tests
* Allow for further widget customization
