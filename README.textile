h1. ShareThis

This plugin should help you easily and unobtrusively integrate ShareThis in your rails app.

h2. Installation

  rails plugin install git://github.com/ample/sharethis.git

This should create sharethis.yml in your config directory. Add your publisher key as well as any widget customizations.

h2. Usage

There are three parts to the integration:

*1. A javascript include tag before the </body> of your html layout*

    <%= raw include_sharethis_if_needed %>

*2. Declaration in controller of your choice*

    uses_sharethis

*3. Within the view where the button should appear*

  <%= sharethis :title => "Title to be shared.", :url => "http://www.sharethis.com/" %>

h2. TODO

* Write more tests
* Allow for further widget customization
